<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![4D LIDAR](https://github.com/alexmoica/LunarLiDAR_IAC/assets/6493847/05b9655d-c3b6-493d-bf24-2741cb7caca0)

<p>The recent advance of 4D LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology has opened up a new set of possibilities to explore space in much greater detail. This innovative technology is based on the principle of the Doppler effect, which enables it to compute instant velocity in real-time and hence adds a fourth dimension to its preceding technology. In 2022, AEVA, a company specialized in the production of autonomous driving sensors, developed the 4D LIDAR, a new tool that will revolutionize autonomous driving. This new generation of lidars offers better performance in terms of depth, instant velocity, reflectivity, and vision.</p>

<p>In recent times, the exploration of the lunar surface and utilization of lunar resources has become a dominant agenda of several government space agencies and private companies. Furthermore, with the rapid growth in the New Space sector, organizations would continue to highly invest in lunar exploration. With an apparent increase in rover missions in the near future, the ability of the rover system to identify other moving rovers and compute its velocity would become a critical design parameter.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is to study the performance of the 4D LIDAR, combined with other onboard components using sensor fusion, and how it can help achieve better results when covering an undiscovered area with unknown environmental parameters.</p>

<p>The project plans to integrate the 4D LIDAR technology with different onboard sensors, evaluate its performance theoretically using software simulation, and present the final data illustrating the overall results. This would help demonstrate the higher performance parameters and precision levels that could be achieved for future rover missions.</p>

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

To run the lunar rover simulation, follow these steps:
1. Open a new terminal in your ROS2 workspace and run `source install/setup.bash`
2. In the terminal, navigate to `/src/lunar_rover`
3. To run the 3D LiDAR simulation: `./start.sh 3d`
4. To run the 4D LiDAR simulation: `./start.sh 4d`

  <img src="media/gazebo.png" alt="gazebo window" width="33%" style="text-align: center;">
</div>

Once the last command is executed, RViz and Gazebo will open, simulating the lunar rover. The rover employs SLAM to scan and navigate its environment, utilizing its onboard LiDAR.

<div style="display: inline-block;"><img src="media/avoidance_action_server.png" alt="avoidance action server log" width="33%" style="display: block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>

For the avoidance system, an avoidance server is initiated first. This server accepts requests from an avoidance client regarding whether to provide an avoidance goal to the rover or not.

<br>
<div style="display: inline-block;"><img src="media/avoidance_4d.png" alt="avoidance publisher log" width="33%" style="display: block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>

Next, a publishing server is launched, continuously broadcasting the locations of any rovers in the scene. If the `4d` option was selected, it will also publish their velocities.

<br>
<div style="display: inline-block;"><img src="media/avoidance_subscriber.png" alt="avoidance subscriber/client log" width="33%" style="display: block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>

A subscriber is initiated to listen to this server and calculate the collision risk between rovers. This is done by measuring the distance between the rovers (for `3d`) and considering the velocity vectors of both rovers (for `4d`). This subscriber also functions as the avoidance client, sending a request to the avoidance server to execute an avoidance maneuver when a collision risk is detected.

<!-- RESULTS & FINDINGS -->
## Results & Findings

**UR = User Rover**
<br>
**OR = Obstacle Rover**

### Test 1: Increasing the speed of the OR

**Rationale**
<br>
To test the performance of the rover in a scenario with dynamic or unpredictable elements, requiring faster decision making.
<br>
<br>

**Initial Conditions**
<br>
`UR:` Begin at (0,0) and move towards the goal (9,-9) at a maximum speed of 0.36 units/s and with a maximum rotation speed of 1.0 rad/s
<br>
<br>
`OR Speed x1:` Begin at (12, -5) and patrol between (12, -5) and (4, -5) at a speed of 0.2667 units/s
<br>
<br>
`OR Speed x2:` Speed increased to 0.5333 units/s
<br>
<br>
`OR Speed x4:` Speed increased to 1.0667 units/s
<br>
<br>

**Results**

<div style="display: inline-block;"><img src="media/T1_graph.png" alt="T1 graph" width="66%" style="display: block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>
<br>

Average UR Speeds by Test Case

|  | OR Speed x1  | OR Speed x2 | OR Speed x4 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 3D  | 0.10 units/s  | 0.11 units/s  | 0.12 units/s  |
| 4D  | 0.19 units/s  | 0.20 units/s  | 0.18 units/s  |
<br>
<br>

**Findings**
<br>
The most important aspect of this test was the occurrence of collisions as the OR's speed increased. At Speed x4, the 3D LIDAR couldn't avoid collisions in a few cases since the UR had already crossed onto the OR's path when it detected it, and due to high speeds, the OR couldn't avoid in time. In contrast, the 4D LIDAR could make more significant corrections due to knowing the velocity information of the OR. There is no meaningful change in the amount of time to the goal, any variation can be attributed to the OR's location in its path when it was intersected by the UR.
<br>
<br>


### Test 2: Increasing the speed of the UR

**Rationale**
<br>
To test the ability of the rover to handle high-speed navigation and obstacle avoidance.
<br>
<br>

**Initial Conditions**
<br>
`OR:` Begin at (12, -5) and patrol between (12, -5) and (4, -5) at a speed of 0.2667 units/s
<br>
<br>
`UR Speed x1:` Begin at (0,0) and move towards the goal (9,-9) at a maximum speed of 0.36 units/s and with a maximum rotation speed of 1.0 rad/s
<br>
<br>
`UR Speed x2:` Maximum speed increased to 0.72 units/s and 2.0 rad/s
<br>
<br>
`UR Speed x4:` Maximum speed increased to 1.44 units/s and 4.0 rad/s
<br>
<br>

**Results**

<div style="display: inline-block;"><img src="media/T2_graph.png" alt="T2 graph" width="66%" style="display: block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>
<br>

Average UR Speeds by Test Case

|  | UR Speed x1  | UR Speed x2 | UR Speed x4 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 3D  | 0.10 units/s  | 0.15 units/s  | 0.21 units/s  |
| 4D  | 0.19 units/s  | 0.24 units/s  | 0.32 units/s  |
<br>
<br>


**Findings**
<br>
Both 3D and 4D LIDARs successfully reached the goal in high-speed environments without any collisions. The 4D LIDAR consistently resulted in a faster path, with speed increasing by 23.89% from Speed x1 to x2 and 32.62% from x2 to x4. While the 3D LIDAR was slower overall, it scaled more efficiently due to its algorithm's constant distance from the obstacle rover. This means that the higher UR speeds saved time after obstacle avoidance as the UR moved towards the goal. Since the 4D LIDAR's pathing doesn't experience such significant rate increases, it implies that it's a more efficient algorithm overall compared to the 3D LIDAR.
<br>
<br>


### Test 3: Placing an obstacle between the rovers

**Rationale**
<br>
To test the rover's ability to respond to both stationary and moving obstacles, particularly in scenarios where it has minimal time to detect the moving obstacle.
<br>
<br>


**Initial Conditions**
<br>
`OR:` Begin at (12, -5) and patrol between (12, -5) and (4, -5) at a speed of 0.2667 units/s
<br>
<br>
`UR:` Begin at (0,0) and move towards the goal (9,-9) at a maximum speed of 0.36 units/s and with a maximum rotation speed of 1.0 rad/s
<br>
<br>
`Static Obstacle:` Wall measuring 4 units in the x-direction and 0.5 units in the y-direction, centered at (3, -3)
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

**Results**

<div style="display: inline-block;"><img src="media/T3_graph.png" alt="T3 graph" width="66%" style="display: block; margin-right: 10px;"></div>
<br>

Average UR Speeds by Test Case

|  | No Obstacle | With Obstacle |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 3D  | 0.10 units/s  | 0.07 units/s  |
| 4D  | 0.19 units/s  | 0.18 units/s  |
<br>
<br>


**Findings**
<br>
Both LIDARS were able to navigate to the goal without collisions when a static obstacle was introduced. The 4D LIDAR did not suffer a meaningful decrease in average speed, taking extra time to navigate around the wall but still plotting an effecient path around the OR, while the 3D LIDAR experienced an additional pathing delay between navigating around the wall and avoiding the OR.

<!-- CONCLUSION -->
## Conclusion

The 4D LIDAR algorithm used in this study consistently demonstrated better efficiency and safety compared to the 3D LIDAR algorithm across all three tested scenarios. The 4D LIDAR system consistently reached the goal in a significantly shorter amount of time and, more importantly, without any collisions. These results underscore the significant advantage of adopting the 4D LIDAR technology for a lunar rover, ensuring not only faster task completion but also a heightened level of safety during its operations in dynamic and obstacle-rich environments.
